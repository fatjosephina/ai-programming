# ai-programming
A repository to hold my assignments for my AI Programming class.
## Week 4: Graphs
This week we did the graphs assignment, which converts an adjacency matrix into a directed graph. To view all of the files for this assignment, click [>here<](https://github.com/fatjosephina/ai-programming/tree/main/Graphs1). To view the Form1.cs file for this assignment, click [>here<](https://github.com/fatjosephina/ai-programming/blob/main/Graphs1/Graphs1/Form1.cs). To run the assignment, clone the repository to GitHub Desktop or download .zip file by clicking on the green **<> Code** button above. Then, unzip the file if necessary and open the Graphs1.sln file and click play.

Update: The project has been updated based on feedback. A new form is now created when the user clicks the button, and the edges can now be multidirectional.
## Week 6: Permutations and Counting
This week we did the permutations and counting assignment, which calculates all permutations of 5P1...5P5 and their count, all ordered partitions where n = length of input and their count, and all combinations of 5P1...5P5 and their count. To view all of the files for this assignment, click [>here<](https://github.com/fatjosephina/ai-programming/tree/main/PermutationsAndCounting). To view the Program.cs file for this assignment, click [>here<](https://github.com/fatjosephina/ai-programming/blob/main/PermutationsAndCounting/PermutationsAndCounting/Program.cs). To run the assignment, clone the repository to GitHub Desktop by clicking by clicking on the green **<> Code** button above or download the .zip file by clicking [>here<](https://github.com/fatjosephina/ai-programming/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Then, unzip the file if necessary and open the PermutationsAndCounting.sln file and click play.
## Week 7: Finite State Machine
This week we did the finite state machine assignment, which uses a finite state machine to simulate a vending machine. The finite state machine checks the current state and an input, and decides the state to transition to and the output based on that. All of the items dispensed by the vending machine are singletons.
